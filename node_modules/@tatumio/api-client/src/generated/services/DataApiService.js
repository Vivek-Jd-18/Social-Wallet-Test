If the <code>contractAddresses</code> parameter is also used in the filter combination, any tokens specified in it will also be included in the list.</li>
     * <li><code>uniswapTrade</code>: Provides all swap events that occur on both Uniswap V2 and V3. In some cases, it may not be possible to map the swapped amounts to specific tokens.
